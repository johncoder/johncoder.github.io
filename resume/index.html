		<p>Designed and built a scalable backend for collaborative document editing based on <a href="https://yjs.dev/">Yjs</a> and Redis. On this project, I got to deep dive in TypeScript and CRDT implementations. Built a new pipeline for uploading images using pre-signed URLs. Prior to working on design process tools, I worked on features for our Ruby API, and supporting Go services, and PostgreSQL database migrations. Used monitoring and tracing tools to support services in production. Some Terraform and AWS contributions. Built an automated backup strategy with a gradual, probablistic rollout.</p>
		<p>On the client side, I used knowledge of the git protocol to optimize fetch operations in a client side Go application. Also worked on opening untracked files, fetching branches, and experimented with shallow repositories and deepening. Troubleshooting git repositories. Implemented progress reporting for fetch operations in a fork of go-git. JavaScript SDK contributions.</p>
